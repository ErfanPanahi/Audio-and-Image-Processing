# Audio-and-Image-Signal-Processing-
In the image processing section of this repository, I address noise reduction using MATLAB's Fdatool and echo cancellation through Cepstrum transformation. Additionally, within the image processing domain, I explore solutions for enhancing image quality, ultimately culminating in the concept of scanning a paper sheet.

The completed sections of the project are as follows:

**1- Audio Signal Processing**

In this section, the process of echo and noise removal is examined using various filters.

a. Single Echo Filter

b. Noise Reduction Using FIR Filters (fdatool)

**2- Image Processing**
