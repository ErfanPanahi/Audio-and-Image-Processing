# Audio-and-Image-Signal-Processing-
In the image processing section of this repository, I address noise reduction using MATLAB's Fdatool and echo cancellation through Cepstrum transformation. Additionally, within the image processing domain, I explore solutions for enhancing image quality, ultimately culminating in the concept of scanning a paper sheet.
